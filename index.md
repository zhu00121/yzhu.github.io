## About Me

I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Biostatistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>'s <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Grossman School of Medicine</a>,
<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  -->
working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/thaddeus-tarpey" target="_blank"> Thaddeus Tarpey</a>. My research involves developing statistical models that cater to high-dimensional complex data, such as functional and imaging data.

I'm currently a 3rd-year PhD candidate at <a href="https://musaelab.ca/" target="_blank"> Multisensory Signal Anlysis and Enhancement Lab (MuSAE)</a>, <a href="https://inrs.ca/en/" target="_blank"> National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS)</a> (Montreal, Canada), supervised by <a href="https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/tiago-h-falk/" target="_blank"> Prof.Tiago H. Falk</a>.

My research is at the intersection of multi-modal signal processing and deep learning, with a focus on audio and speech analysis. My PhD research is centred around the development of generalizable, trustworthy, and secure audio representations. Some of the main application fields cover voice conversion/anonymization, deepfake speech and adversarial attack detection, respiratory sound understanding and health diagnostics. 



In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://about.google" target="_blank"> Google</a>, where I applied my statistical skills to real-world problems. 
Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master's degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target = "_blank"> Cornell University</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://www.idiaz.xyz" target = "_blank"> Iván Díaz</a>, and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>. 

<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.
