## About Me

I'm currently a 3rd-year PhD candidate at <a href="https://musaelab.ca/" target="_blank"> Multisensory Signal Analysis and Enhancement Lab (MuSAE)</a>, <a href="https://inrs.ca/en/" target="_blank"> National Institute of Scientific Research (INRS)</a> (Montreal, Canada), supervised by <a href="https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/tiago-h-falk/" target="_blank"> Prof.Tiago H. Falk</a>.

My research is at the intersection of multi-modal signal processing and deep learning, with a focus on audio and speech analysis. My PhD research is centred around the development of generalizable, trustworthy, and secure audio representations. Some of the main application fields cover voice conversion/anonymization, deepfake speech and adversarial attack detection, respiratory sound understanding and health diagnostics. I also work part-time with <a href="https://www.nectar.buzz/" target="_blank"> Nectar</a> on multi-modal sensor data analysis and machine learning for automated beehive monitoring.


## Research Interests
- **Multimodal Signal Processing:** Audio, speech, sensors, and bio-signal analysis
- **Deep Learning:** Generalizable and explainable representations; Self-supervised learning
- **Speech:** Voice conversion and anonymization; Characterization of speech abnormalities
- **Cybersecurity:** Deepfake speech and adversarial attack detection
- **Healthcare:** Disease detection; sound event detection


## Awards
- **[June. 2023]** <a href="https://2023.ieeeicassp.org/" target="_blank">*Rising Star in Signal Processing* at ICASSP 2023 </a> for outstanding PhD research
